# notes from Salem
- Could be a problem when uploading CSV files - need a way to alert the user how the CSV file should look / be formatted - needs to be specified in the design
- CSV file requirements will be explained during scrum review and implemented into next version

---

# for next version
- specification document, design, model, and then need an object to manipulate the dataset into a proper format
- Add area for plot / result display
- csv data parsing should dynamically identify data columns and place them in a standard order and / or the model should be able to identify which data points are which on its own even if data is not in the same order each time.
- **Expand Input Fields**: Adding additional fields for other relevant data points, such as income or credit score will improve the application’s functionality.
- **Implement Eligibility Logic**: The actual loan eligibility evaluation logic needs to be added to the ‘check_eligibility’ method.
- **Styling**: Different designs and styling could be explored to improve the visual appeal of the GUI.sti

# TODOs:
## Deadline: Simply display slight progress by Wednesday. No new presentation until significant progress has been made.
- Will: continue working on model development and push updates as needed
- Ahriel: manual entry page -- add fields for data collection and a button to parse fields into a dataframe
- Gyanu / Sulav: experiment with the UI aesthetics to see what looks nice (if you have time) - start working on pre-processing for data - get CSV import / manual entry to dataframe working and organize data into a standard order in the frame.
- Jamie: display plot / result display + code review / update the specification document / compile issue documentation for this round (send bugs/ issues and how you fixed them w/ screenshots and I will compile)
