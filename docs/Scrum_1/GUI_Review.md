# Loan Eligibility Predictor - GUI Review

## Overview
The very first basic version of graphical user interface (GUI) for our Loan Eligibility Predictor allows users to either load a CSV file containing data or manually enter data to check loan eligibility. The application is built using Python's Tkinter library.

## Functionality
- The application loads without errors. The primary components such as buttons for loading data and switching to manual entry are functional.
- Input validation has been implemented to ensure that users provide valid data which improves the user experience.
- The "Check Eligibility" button is connected to a placeholder function that will later contain the logic for loan eligibility evaluation.

## Code Quality
- **Readability**: The code is clear and well-structured, making it easy to understand and follow.
- **Structure**: The code is organized properly, separating different components into classes.

## Future Improvement
- **Expand Input Fields**: Adding additional fields for other relevant data points, such as income or credit score will improve the application’s functionality.
- **Implement Eligibility Logic**: The actual loan eligibility evaluation logic needs to be added to the ‘check_eligibility’ method.
- **Styling**: Different designs and styling could be explored to improve the visual appeal of the GUI.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a solid foundation for a Loan Eligibility Predictor application. With further enhancements and the implementation of additional features, it can become a more functional and user-friendly tool.
