### notes from 2.19.25:
add a branch to architecure diagram which includes all python libraries

while coding, record every error you have and write them down- record them as part of your system architecture

once done with the project, put all the problems we faced from the system architecture into our scrums so we can see the big picture (SCrum review)

the uml diagram should have all the system libraries represented and linked together 

**make it simple**

mame it as a standalone application instead of web app and make it simple

first cut of program by friday or monday - code, record problems you faced, and those of us doing documentation we need to know what the programmers faced and how they solved it. later on this will be used in the AGILE modeling and scrum reviews.
